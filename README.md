Hello and welcome to the APEX skills assessment.

This is a simple CRA based application with 3 primary user requirements:

1.) Add functionality to input field and update button to allow user to update the header with their name.

2.) Header requires functional one second incrementing timer with start/stop capabilities.

3.) Add functionality to load data from local data.json file from public folder and display contents.

Please feel free to use any and all resources at your disposal to achieve the tasks at hand, although preferably without the inclusion of additional libraries. This skills assessment is to test your understanding of React, hooks, and rendering.

To begin, start by importing the Instructions module into the App.js predefined location. From there, the application should update with the instructions directly in the page.

You are welcome to ask any questions you may have during the initial explanation. Additional questions can be sent to robert.s.baker2@boeing.com between 9-5:30pm PST, and we will do our best to get back to you.

Please commit your skills assessment within 24 hours of the interview.

Thank you and happy programming!
